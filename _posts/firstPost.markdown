Assignment: Check if the predicate (second argument) is truthy on all elements of a collection (first argument).
Or, in plain English, do all of the elements in the objects / collections share the property we're looking for?

The breakdown and pseudo-code:

Loop through the all of the collections(objects).

Check if each one has the property we're looking for.

If the property is found, check if it's value is a valid one.

If any of the objects tested comeback as either missing the property or missing a valid value, return FALSE. Otherwise, return TRUE.
